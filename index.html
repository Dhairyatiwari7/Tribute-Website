                <h1>Missile Man of India.</h1>

                <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, India, was a distinguished scientist known as the "Missile Man of India" 
                    for his pivotal role in India's missile and space programs. As the 11th President of India (2002-2007), he emphasized education, 
                , and youth empowerment. Kalam's vision for India, outlined in his book "India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium," 
                aimed at transforming the country into a developed nation through innovation and human capital. His leadership and humility earned 
                him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, leaving a lasting legacy as a role model 
                and inspiration for generations, particularly in the fields of science, education, and national development.
